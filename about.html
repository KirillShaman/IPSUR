<h3 id="sec-1-1">What <code>IPSUR</code> is: </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">


<p>
<code>IPSUR</code> stands for <i>Introduction to Probability and Statistics Using R</i>, ISBN: 978-0-557-24979-4, which is a textbook written for an undergraduate course in probability and statistics. The approximate prerequisites are two or three semesters of calculus and some linear algebra in a few places.  Attendees of the class include mathematics, engineering, and computer science majors.  
</p>
<p>
<code>IPSUR</code> is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">FREE</a>, in the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> sense of the word. Hard copies are available for purchase <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-using-r/8123594">here</a> from Lulu and will be available (coming soon) from the other standard online retailers worldwide. The price of the book is exactly 
the manufacturing cost plus the retailers' markup.  You may be able to get it even cheaper by downloading an electronic copy and printing it yourself, but if you elect this route then be sure to get the publisher-quality 
PDF from the <a href="download.html">Downloads</a> page.  And double check the price. It was cheaper for my students to buy a  <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-using-r/8123594">perfect-bound paperback</a> from Lulu and have it shipped to their door than it was to upload the PDF to Fed-Ex Kinkos and Xerox a coil-bound copy (and on top of that go pick it up at the store).
</p>
<p>
If you are going to buy <code>IPSUR</code> from anywhere other than Lulu then be sure to check the time-stamp on the copyright page.  There is a 6 to 8 week delay from Lulu to Amazon and you may not be getting the absolute latest version available.

Refer to the <a href="install.html">Installation</a> page for instructions to install an electronic copy of <code>IPSUR</code> on your personal computer.  See the <a href="feedback.html">Feedback</a> page for guidance about questions or comments you may have about <code>IPSUR</code>.
</p>
<p>
I have been writing <code>IPSUR</code> on and off since 2006, yet there are many important topics, examples, and exercises still missing from the book.  I will add them as time permits. In the meantime, you can get the latest, greatest version (built daily) from <a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/">R-Forge</a>.  See the <a href="install.html">Installation</a> page for details.
